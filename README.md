# TF_filters_locations-2
ðŸ§¸ðŸ’¬ Tensorflow for object locators, filters and convolution is enough for tracking objects from the plain background and we plan to add DCT ( discrete frequency transform for colours image ). This method is a filters method and different than our previous method detects an object by convolution and scaling or scanning the image for object similarity.
